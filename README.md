# Accelerated Bayesian Causal Forests (XBCF)

## About

This package implements the Accelerated Bayesian Causal Forests approach for conditional average treatment effect estimation. This approach builds on the methodology behind Bayesian Causal Forests outlined in [Hahn et al.](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1580461461) (2020) and incorporates several improvements to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees implemented by [He et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/he19a.html) (2019).

This package is based on the source code of [XBART](https://github.com/JingyuHe/XBART) package and was originally developed as a branch of that repository.

## Installation

To install the package, run from the R console:

```
