# Accelerated Bayesian Causal Forests (XBCF)

## About

This package implements the Accelerated Bayesian Causal Forests approach to the problem of conditional average treatment effect estimation. This approach builds on the methodology behind Bayesian Causal Forests outlined by [Hahn et al.](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1580461461) (2020) and takes advantage of several improvements to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees implemented by [He et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/he19a.html) (2019).
